# Projectified

I just wanted something else but i did this

## Getting Started

clone the project then

```bash
flutter pub get
```

```bash
flutter run
```

## Used Strapi

If you new to it follow some steps here

```bash
npm install -g strapi
```
then

```bash
strapi new <your project>
```
you can choose database environment but I recommend to use mongoDb or MySql

then run your thing

read some strapi documentations and create what you want but faster
